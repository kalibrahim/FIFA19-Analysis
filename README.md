# Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interesed in using FIFA19 player database to analyze:
  1. How Does Age Effect Players Ratings?
  2. How Does The Playerâ€™s Overall and Age Effect Their Value and Wage?
  3. How does the distribution of players over teams can constribute to winning titles?
I wanted to understand the relationships between the players' overall and their value, wage and club/nations they belong to. 


# File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>
There is one jupyter notebook here to showcase the work related to the questions above. This notebook contains all of the analysis
done on this dataset. Markdown cells were used to coment out my findings.

# Results<a name="results"></a>
The main findings of this code can be found on a medium post [here](https://medium.com/@kalibrahim/fifa19-how-do-you-become-messi-684c585e48b8).
I found that there is a high relationship between The players' overall rating and value and wages, which for the most part it can contribute for a club/ nation to win a title.
