# Installation<a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interesed in using FIFA19 player database to analyze:
  1. How Does Age Effect Players Ratings?
  2. How Does The Playerâ€™s Overall and Age Effect Their Value and Wage?
  3. How does the distribution of players over teams can constribute to winning titles?

# File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>
There is one jupyter notebook here to showcase the work related to the questions above. This notebook contains all of the analysis
done on this dataset. Markdown cells were used to coment out my findings.

# Results<a name="results"></a>
The main findings of this code can be found on a medium post [here](https://medium.com/@kalibrahim/fifa19-how-do-you-become-messi-684c585e48b8).
